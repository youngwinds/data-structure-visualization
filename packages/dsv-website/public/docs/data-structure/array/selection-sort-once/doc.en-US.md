# Selection Sort (Once)

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum(or maximum) element and putting it at the beginning of the array.

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1. The subarray which is already sorted.
2. Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum(or maximum) element from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
