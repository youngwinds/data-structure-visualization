# Three Steps Problem

A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs. The result may be large, so return it modulo 1000000007.

Example1：

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 4
```

Example2：

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 13
```
