# Knapsack Problem

There are n items expressed by weightarr and valuearr.

weightarr means weight w1,w2,w3...wn,

valuearr means value v1,v2,v3...vn.

Given a knapsack with a maximum load-bearing capacity of maxweight, find the most valuable subset of the items placed in the knapsack (the sum of the weights of the items cannot exceed the maximum load-bearing capacity of the knapsack).
